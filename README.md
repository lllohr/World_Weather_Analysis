# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of Project
This was an exciting project! This new assignment consists of three technical analyses. We used the Open Weather Map API and Google Directions API to retrieve weather data, to create custom maps, and creating an itinerary map. I was required to submit the following deliverables:

-Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data

-Deliverable 2: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map

-Deliverable 3: Create a Travel Itinerary Map

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to become familiarized with utilizing API calls to access data, perform specific tasks, to run analysis, and explore the capabilities of the API.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Some of the most difficult challenges I faced was using the to_numpy() function and list indexing to write code to retrieve the latitude-longitude pairs as tuples from each city DataFrame. I struggled with this for several hours. I scoured many examples, reviewed panda documentation, read about the numpy() function, learned much more about arrays and list indexing, and tuples. The hints were not very enlightening and finding an appropriate way of drawing out the latitude-longitude pairs as tuples was quite challenging. 

## Results

- The images and maps I was able to create were stunning! I was so excited to see what I created. It seems like the API capabilites are limitless!
